### What is this project about?
  This project is an open-source Roblox game template designed to be a toolkit everyone needsâ€”especially to those who wants to create their own games but lack coding skills. Throughout my time as a programmer, I have seen many people who might not know how to start requesting for codes, so I have made this project to bridge that gap. It offers a foundational structure that users can customize and improve on, with a certain level of programming, of course.

  My goal is to let more people to make their game ideas come to life on Roblox Platform, by making game development more accessible and less intimidating. I hope this ready-to-use game template destroy the technical barriers that are preventing creative ideas.

### Updates and Maintenance
  I plan to update the template around a month to two. These updates will likely include new features, impprovements to the existing codebase, bug fixes, and perhaps new documentation to help users wheather you are a complete beginner or someone with coding knowledge looking to make their game development easier.
